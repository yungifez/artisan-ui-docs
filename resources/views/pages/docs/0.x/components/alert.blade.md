## Dismissable alert
The `alert` component supports being dismissed (ie the alert can be hidden when the close button is pressed).

<x-component-preview component="previews.alert-dismiss-demo"></x-component-preview>

## Dismiss On Timeout
Additionally, an alert can be dismissed after a timeout

<x-component-preview component="previews.alert-dismiss-on-timeout-demo"></x-component-preview>
